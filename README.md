Git is the most popular [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). It tracks changes you make to files and keeps a record of your work. It also lets you revert to earlier versions of your code if the need arises. Git also drastically improves collaboration, allowing multiple people to work in sync on the same source code. Below is a selection of the most helpful and commonly used Git commands to power up your programming!

*Note - Wherever used the shorthand `Repo` means [Repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control))*

The [Docs](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/UltimateGitResource/tree/main/docs) folder of this repo contains a simple profile/resume static site built on HTML5 and [TailwindCSS](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/) to help learn about [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can clone the repository and test it out yourself, or visit [this link](https://goldinguy.github.io/UltimateGitResource/) to see a live demo. For more info look at the [README](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/UltimateGitResource/blob/main/docs/README.md) for the `/docs` directory.

This repo contains a powerpoint presentation explaning many of these commands that can be viewed online [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BHa_ZxiyRRJQKaCRXTozmMhlPgkFcx-zn5esd5n-HWY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Git Commands

You can run `git help` in the terminal to learn about many of these commands at any time. `git help -a` and `git help -g` list available subcommands and 
concept guides. `git help <command>` or `git help <concept>` allow you to read about a specific subcommand or concept.

`HEAD` represents your current working directory. The `HEAD` pointer can be moved to different branches, tags, or commits using `git checkout`.

The `gitignore` file allows you to control what gets committed and what doesn't, allowing you to keep your keys and passwords secure, and reducing the amount of bloat on the remote repo. You can learn more about it in the [.gitignore file](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/UltimateGitResource/blob/main/.gitignore) above.
