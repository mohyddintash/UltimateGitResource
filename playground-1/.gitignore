### GIT_IGNORE - This is where you list files you don't want to commit, such as files containing API keys, passwords, or auto-generated files specific to your machine

## EXAMPLES ##

# You can prepend a pattern with a double asterisk to match directories anywhere in the repository
**/logs

# You can also use a double asterisk to match files based on their name and the name of their parent directory
**/logs/debug.log

# An asterisk is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters
*.log

# By default, patterns match files in any directory
debug.log

# If you don't append a slash, the pattern will match both files and the contents of directories with that name. In the example matches on the left, both directories and files named logs are ignored
logs

# Appending a slash indicates the pattern is a directory. The entire contents of any directory in the repository matching that name – including all of its files and subdirectories – will be ignored
logs/

# A question mark matches exactly one character
debug?.log

# Square brackets can also be used to match a single character from a specified range
debug[0-9].log

# Square brackets match a single character form the specified set
debug[01].log

# An exclamation mark can be used to match any character except one from the specified set
debug[!01].log

# Ranges can be numeric or alphabetic
debug[a-z].log

# A double asterisk matches zero or more directories
logs/**/debug.log

# Wildcards can be used in directory names as well
logs/*day/debug.log

# Patterns specifying a file in a particular directory are relative to the repository root. (You can prepend a slash if you like, but it doesn't do anything special.)
logs/debug.log

## It's a common practice to name files or directories that get ignored with a "." in front - For example:

# Compiled source #
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*.exe
*.o
*.so

# Packages #
# it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source
# git has its own built in compression methods
*.7z
*.dmg
*.gz
*.iso
*.jar
*.rar
*.tar
*.zip

# Logs and databases #
*.log
*.sql
*.sqlite

# OS generated files #
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db
