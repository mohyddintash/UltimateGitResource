# GENERIC README

This is a demo site to practice using Git and Github Pages. It is a basic portfolio/resume template. Feel free to alter/edit it to your liking. If you have experience with Web Dev, feel free to use a completely different site for the lab.

Profile photos are randomly pulled from [ThisPersonDoesNotExist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/). Every time you refresh you should see a different one.

The quickest way to edit the site is to `Ctrl-F` for the default person "Alex B. Carroll" and replace it with your name. Then do the same for their email "alexbcarroll@hey.com", address, linkedIn, and so on. It will likely require a basic knowledge of HTML5.

You can change the font to anything you like from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) by replacing the name of the font in the HTML link.

If you know what you're doing, to switch to the advanced version of tailwind do the following:

- Move the files in the `tailwind_adv` folder into the /docs directory
- Run `npm install`
- Remove the `Tailwind CDN styles link` in the `index.html` file, and uncomment the code in `css/styles.css`
- Run `npm serve` to try out the site!

It will look exactly the same as it currently does, so the only change will be a marginal decrease in load time. For the purposes of this lab, the CDN link will work just fine.

This template is based on an open-source portfolio site found [here](https://github.com/mohusman360/mohusman360.github.io)
