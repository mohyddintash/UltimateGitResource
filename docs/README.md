# GENERIC README

This is a demo site to practice using Git and Github Pages. It is a basic portfolio/resume template. Feel free to alter/edit it to your liking. If you have experience with Web Dev, feel free to use a completely different site for the lab.

Profile photos are randomly pulled from [ThisPersonDoesNotExist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/). Every time you refresh you should see a different one.

The quickest way to edit the site is to `Ctrl-F` for the default person "Alex B. Carroll" and replace it with your name. Then do the same for their email "alexbcarroll@hey.com", address, linkedIn, and so on. It will likely require a basic knowledge of HTML5.

You can change the font to anything you like from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) by replacing the name of the font in the HTML link.

You can also use any of the [TailwindCSS](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/) classes to edit your styling.

This template is based on an open-source portfolio site found [here](https://github.com/mohusman360/mohusman360.github.io)
